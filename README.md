#Description:
Safety is of paramount importance for all businesses, homes or fields of agriculture. This has always been presented in human history. An intrusion alarm system can inform those responsible for an intruder, remotely and then guarantee the safety of people and / or equipment.

There are several security systems used today for surveillance, including:
• An anti-theft security system that protects the business or residence against attempted theft and intruders.
• An access control system that limits access to pre-authorized people to training rooms or laboratories for reasons of confidentiality.
We have noticed that each system is independent of the other. Also the technology of the Internet of things is not well exploited in the fields of security. This can cause problems like lack of monitoring, management and configuration of remote controlled systems.

To solve the problems of the current systems, we will design a complete autonomous electronic monitoring and detection system which ensures the protection of the photovoltaic panels against intrusions.
This system will be equipped with several sensors that will be installed in the fields for surveillance and an alarm system also using motion detectors and laser detectors ... etc.
To control this system, a hybrid mobile application will be used which allows the operation of the system to be controlled remotely.



#Context:
In this part, we will detail the limits of the current solution. Next, we will present the best proposed solutions. To fully understand our project we define the technology we used "Internet of Things", after that we present the security system, the alarm system and the surveillance.

• What is an Internet of Things?
The Internet of Things (IOT) is a global infrastructure for the information society, which provides advanced services by interconnecting objects (physical or virtual) using existing interoperable information and communication technologies or evolving.

• What is a security system? [1]
A security system is a set of elements put in place to detect a potentially dangerous situation and prevent its consequences. In general, it consists of detection parts, a control module and an alarm. The efficiency of the system is markedly improved when it is linked to a monitoring station, since this is what ensures rapid intervention by the competent authorities and, consequently, increased security.


• What is surveillance? [2]
Surveillance is the function of observing human activities. In the purely technical field, we also speak of supervision or monitoring.

• What is an alarm system? [3]
An alarm system is a safety device intended to warn (most often by means of an audible signal) the owner of the danger of the place where the alarm is installed. The purpose of an alarm system is therefore to send information through a signal in order to provoke a reaction (intervention of the emergency services, flight of the thief, etc.).
For this, it must be possible to recognize the situation as a danger by the system.
